Time Complexity - Tells us about the efficiency of an algorithm when the size of 
                  the input is enormous.
                  
Space Complexity - Tells us about the memory used by an algorithm when the size of 
                  the input is enormous.
                  
Big O Notation - Express the complexity

O(1) - Constant - Takes the same amount of time or space regardless the size of the input.
O(log n) - BinarySearch
O(n) - Linear (for loops)
O(n log n) - QuickSort and MergeSort (Divide and Conquer Family)
O(n2) - Quadratic - Nested For - Bad - BubbleSort, InsertionSort, SelectionSort
O(2^n) - Exponential - Bad.
